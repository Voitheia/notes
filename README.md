# notes

This repository contains my notes on hacking and administrating Windows machines. They will be updated as I learn more about the two subjects, as I only became seriously interested in cybersecurity in the fall of 2020. These are notes that I originally wrote for myself, so expect to see descriptions like "does exploit things." Hopefully, by making these notes public, I will be able to help others improve their knowledge as well.

If you think I am missing anything or have suggestions for these documents, please feel free to reach out.
